# From "ik spreek geen Nederlands" to A2 Dutch

Today I passed all of my Dutch A2 exams (reading, writing and speaking).

This isn't post where I talk about the miracle of passing through Duolingo alone, but a review of the six-month course experience offered for free by the Dutch government.

## FREE DUTCH COURSES?

The Dutch government subsidizes language courses to facilitate integration into society for both EU and non-EU migrants as part of the Inburgering process, which also includes a 'Life in the Netherlands' module I did not take, since EU citizens don't need this to live and work, but will do if they want to obtain citizenship.

before they can reside and work in the Netherlands. At the time, I started mine for free purely on the basis that I didn't benefit from the “expat” tax treatment, also known as the “30% ruling” – a tax regime for migrants specifically recruited from outside the Netherlands to fill much-needed positions within the country.

I originally wrote this in English for some Dutch friends who were curious what we're taught and how the whole integration process works, as well as a few other non-Dutch people wanted to know what it was like for their own Inburgering process.

Note:
We're told this course changes once every few years depending on the immigration needs and success rates, so some (or all) of this may be out of date beyond July 2020.

And for the sake of this article, I'll keep using “the Dutch” or “they” but the intricacies of who exactly manages it are opaque to you on the receiving end, and so was the criteria.

## Registration and Intake

I heard about the courses when I registered as an Amsterdam resident with city hall, in the process of getting a unique identifier called a BSN. I filled some form, got an automated reply, and two weeks later someone wrote back to say I was eligible, and directed me to the intake test. It was a bit less communication than the over-communication I'd experienced in the US, but so far, so good.

At the intake test it became obvious that they work with local businesses to administer the courses. Later I'd learn there are political complications around which companies and teacher get these contracts, how good the teachers are, etc. but this being a big city, nothing seemed unusual. The one I ended up with had three easily accessible locations around town. You could express a preference for location once you were done with the intake.

The intake consisted of a language placement test, a mini-IQ test, and brief conversation with a representative to tell them about your motivation to study Dutch. Since I'd barely arrived, I skipped the language level placement and started the total beginners track. And since I was retraining to be a programmer and not working, I chose the intensive version: two 3-hour sessions, twice a week for six months.

As a side note, the IQ test was fascinating; it had 20-something language-agnostic questions based on Raven's Matrices https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices and you got the answer immediately. I guessed that it's done for later statistics and correlations, since it had no bearing on placement or acceptance. But it spooked enough people in the intake who worried they'd failed it.

## Courses

The courses are real hard work and not everyone finishes. It's estimated you need 300 hours of practice from beginner to A1 or A2, depending on your own abilities and extra-curricular practice. Most people reach A2 after six months though, even those who don't think learning new languages is their strong suit.

Much of what I wrote here may or will change. They announced a new format for beginner courses starting in September 2020, though not much else.

    The course and materials are free, but the catch is you have to maintain a 70-80% attendance level, and in our case, complete a language portfolio for the city council – more on that later. You get the course book and some basic stationery in a welcome tote bag, so no one can say they don't have a notebook and a pen.

Teachers monitor attendance and record reasons for absence during each class. If you have a good reason to miss a class or stop altogether, that's acceptable – as long as they're discussed with those administering the course. Good reasons would be starting full time work, moving, grave illness, etc. Otherwise you have to pay some share of the course's real value as a fine. Either way, no one is named and shamed. If something changes, but you want to keep learning, they can and will suggest a move to a more appropriate course time or intensity.

You practice in order to pass, and, as part of getting it for free, you're required to show proof of how you practiced outside the class. If you reach the end, the A1/A2 levels are forgiving for newcomers, and teachers want to see you succeed. There's also a broader societal incentive to finish; many people need B or C level Dutch levels to work and study.

One of our requirements was to create a portfolio to show what we did, learned or saw on our own or during school trips. It also formed the basis of the speaking test, to ensure you really experienced those things and wrote it yourself.

As part of this, we had a genuinely cool visit to the biggest public library in the Netherlands. I was skeptical at first because I've only lived in places where libraries are barely funded or closing, despite the social value they provide. I thought it'd be a token visit, but they like their books here and the free language practice services aren't bad. My local library branch was always packed before the pandemic, and people create their own street libraries with free books to swap. They're always in flux, and a joy to see. Membership for the public library starts at around 30 euros per year, which makes it affordable for most people in the course.

The class started with around 20 people aged 18 to 75, but we finished with around half that number.

## Exams

Finally, the exams were pretty easy after all the learning. They include leading questions related to life and customs in the Netherlands in its various aspects, particularly to help those from other cultures who may not be familiar.

## Final thoughts

I'm not paid by the Dutch government to say this, but have to appreciate that they offer learning for free, with some reasonable criteria and expectations. They seem to have worked out that integration doesn't magically happen without the right structure and incentives. It's not an easy language (and they know it), but passing A2 can create a huge dopamine kick and momentum to keep going.

It's a tremendous life and learning experience, and it feels magical to go from barely understanding anything to having small chats with people. You may well switch to English for complex interactions, and my white privilege likely speaks here, but no one ever got upset that I said something imperfect in Dutch. They also never berated me for not knowing, or asking them to speak slower.

I'd do the same for anyone trying to learn Romanian, an even harder language that few people have a good reason to learn.

As for me, I'll likely continue with B1 in September. It makes a world of difference to talk to people in their native language, and it's as enjoyable to my brain as learning a new computer language.
